# YapGenius - Real-Time Team Communication Platform

YapGenius is a modern team communication platform designed to facilitate real-time messaging and collaboration. Drawing inspiration from popular platforms like Slack and Discord, YapGenius provides a streamlined experience focused on essential communication features while maintaining simplicity and performance.

At its core, YapGenius enables users to communicate through both public and private channels, as well as direct messages. Users can create topic-specific channels for team discussions or start direct message conversations with individuals or groups. The platform supports threaded conversations, allowing users to maintain organized discussions within busy channels.

Messages in YapGenius support markdown formatting, making it easy to share formatted text, code snippets, and lists. Users can enhance their communication with emoji reactions, providing quick and expressive ways to respond to messages. File sharing capabilities allow teams to exchange documents, images, and other files up to 50MB in size, with preview support for common formats.

The platform includes a comprehensive search system that helps users find past messages, files, and conversations across all their channels and direct messages. Users can filter search results by sender, date range, and channel, ensuring they can quickly locate important information.

Real-time features are central to YapGenius, with messages and reactions appearing instantly for all participants. The platform tracks user presence and status, showing when team members are online, away, or offline. Users can set custom status messages to let others know their availability or current activities.

Security and user management are handled through a straightforward authentication system, where users can create accounts with email and password. The platform maintains persistent sessions for convenience while ensuring secure access to conversations and files.

YapGenius is built with modern web technologies, utilizing Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates, providing a robust and scalable solution that works reliably across different network conditions and scales effectively as teams grow.
