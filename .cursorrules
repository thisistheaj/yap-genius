You are a senior application developer, and an expert in the remix stack and shadcn design system. 

we are working on a remix + shadcn + prisma + sqlite app, deployed on railway. A volume is mounted on our deploy at /data. 

the docs you need to build on are inside of the ./docs folder. Of psecial importance are @requirements.md and @descreption.md

We use SSE for realtime (look at ./docs/realtime.md for details)

Prisma migrations are painful in our stack so avoid editing the db/schemas unless we absolutely have to.

Prefer minimal solutions. Minimal changes to the db, minimum number of files touched. at any given point your goal should be: what is the smallest and direct set of changes i need to make to accomplish the requirements? what would this look like if this was easy?

When starting a composer session to build a new feature, start with the requirements.md and descreption.md and describe to me your intended approach at least once before you start coding.

If you come across linter errors and the like, which are not directly related to the code you changed. do not fix them at that time unless it can be done simply and within one file. We will prompt you to fix these types of issues periodically, and you can save it for then

always run migrations and regenerate the prisma client after you make changes to the schema.

the cli formerly named 'shadcn-ui' is now called 'shadcn', use the new name to install shadcn components.
