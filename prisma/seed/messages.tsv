leadership	sarah	Mike, we need to discuss Pat's recent performance. I'm concerned about their output.
leadership	mike	I've noticed too. The last three sprints have been below expectations.
leadership	sarah	What steps have you taken to address this?
leadership	mike	I've had two 1:1s about delivery timelines, but haven't seen improvement.
leadership	sarah	Let's monitor for another sprint, but we may need to make a tough decision.
leadership	mike	Agreed. I'll document everything carefully and we can reassess in two weeks.
leadership	sarah	Perfect. Let's keep this between us for now.

engineering	alex	Pat, that was supposed to be done last week... ðŸ¤”
engineering	pat	I know, sorry. The edge cases are more complex than I thought.
engineering	mike	Let's pair up tomorrow to get it finished.

engineering	pat	Thanks, I'll take a look.
