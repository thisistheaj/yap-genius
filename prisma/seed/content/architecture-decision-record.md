# Architecture Decision Record: BigCorp Integration
ADR-001
Status: Approved
Date: 2024-03-15

## Context
BigCorp integration requires processing large volumes of data (500k records per import) with strict security and performance requirements. We need to design a scalable, secure, and maintainable architecture.

## Decision
We will implement an event-driven architecture using AWS services with the following components:

### API Layer
- API Gateway for request handling
- Custom authorizer for HMAC validation
- Rate limiting via Redis cluster

### Processing Layer
- SQS for job queue management
- Lambda functions for async processing
- DynamoDB for job status tracking

### Real-time Updates
- WebSocket API for progress updates
- Redis pub/sub for worker communication

### Security Layer
- HMAC authentication
- AES-256 encryption at rest
- Customer-specific encryption keys

## Alternatives Considered

### Synchronous Processing
❌ Rejected due to:
- Timeout limitations
- Resource inefficiency
- Poor user experience for large imports

### Self-hosted Queue
❌ Rejected due to:
- Operational overhead
- Scaling complexity
- Reliability concerns

### Direct Database Import
❌ Rejected due to:
- Lack of validation
- Security concerns
- No progress tracking

## Consequences

### Positive
- Scalable to handle varying load
- Built-in fault tolerance
- Real-time progress updates
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to monitor and debug

### Negative
- More complex infrastructure
- Multiple components to maintain
- Higher AWS costs
- Need for careful error handling

## Implementation Details

### Request Flow
```
Client -> API Gateway
       -> HMAC Validation
       -> Rate Limit Check
       -> Create Job (DynamoDB)
       -> Queue Message (SQS)
       -> Return Job ID
```

### Processing Flow
```
SQS -> Lambda Worker
    -> Process Batch
    -> Update Progress (DynamoDB)
    -> Notify WebSocket
    -> Handle Errors
```

### Monitoring Points
1. API Gateway metrics
2. Lambda execution stats
3. Queue depth
4. Processing speed
5. Error rates
6. WebSocket connections

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- HMAC signatures required
- API keys with expiration
- IP whitelisting option

### Encryption
- TLS 1.3 in transit
- AES-256 at rest
- Key rotation policy

### Audit
- CloudWatch logs
- CloudTrail for API calls
- Custom audit events

## Performance Targets

### Throughput
- 1000 req/min API rate
- 5 concurrent imports
- 100k records/10min

### Latency
- API response: < 100ms
- WebSocket updates: < 1s
- Job status: < 500ms

## Cost Considerations
- Lambda execution time
- API Gateway requests
- WebSocket connections
- DynamoDB throughput
- SQS message volume

## Future Considerations
1. Multi-region deployment
2. Customer-specific queues
3. Enhanced monitoring
4. Automated scaling
5. Backup strategy

## Team Impact
- New AWS services to learn
- WebSocket implementation
- Security best practices
- Performance optimization

## Dependencies
1. AWS Account
2. Redis Enterprise
3. Security review
4. Performance testing

## Success Metrics
1. Processing speed
2. Error rates
3. Customer satisfaction
4. System stability
5. Operational overhead

## Rollout Plan
1. Infrastructure setup
2. Security review
3. Load testing
4. Gradual customer onboarding
